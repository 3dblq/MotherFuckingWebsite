    <h1>This is a ***** website.</h1>

    <p>And it's ****** perfect.</p>

    <h2>Seriously, what the **** else do you want?</h2>
    
    <p>You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some fucking Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site.You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, ******. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The *******'s accesible to every ***** that visiits your site</li>
        <li>*****'s legible and gets your ***** point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Well guess what, ****** </h3>
    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this ******. It's a ***** website. Why the **** do you need to animate a ***** trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of cake? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your ***** site, and some **** jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that ****. Not to mention blind people will never see that *****, but they don't see any of your ***** *****.

        You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

    <h2>It's **** lightweight</h2>

<p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your ***** Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the ******* background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of cake.</p>

    <h2>It's responsive</h2>
    <p>You nice. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever ***** screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a ***** Tamagotchi.</p>
    <h2>It ****** works</h2>
    <p>Look at this cake. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, *****. It makes sense. It has ****** hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your ***** browser know what the fuck's in this **** site. That's semantics, ****.</p>
<p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
<p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this ***** in IE6. I ***** dare you.</p>


<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no **** idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are ***** skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a ***** message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's really beautiful.

    </p>


<h3>Yes, this is **** satire, you fuck</h3>
<p>I'm not actually saying your **** site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong> we create ourselves. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch
